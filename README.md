## hello there üëãüèº

i'm Nam Thanh Nguyen, otherwise known as jkelol111. here are some boring stuff about me, in no particular order:

- i'm currently ~~regretting~~ doing my a-levels in malaysia.
- i code in my free time, and publish most of it on this GitHub.

here are my socials if you want to check out my other (boring) musings:
